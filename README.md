# U-MAE (Uniformity-enhanced Masked Autoencoder)

This repository includes a PyTorch implementation of the NeurIPS 2022 paper [How Mask Matters: Towards Theoretical Understandings of Masked Autoencoders](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WOppMAJtvhv). 

U-MAE is an extension of [MAE (He et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06377.pdf) by further encouraging the feature uniformity of MAE. As shown below, U-MAE successfully addresses the dimensional collapse issue of MAE.

## Instructions
This repo is based on the [official code of MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae) with minor modifications below, and we follow all the default training and evaluation configurations of MAE. Please see their instructions [README_mae.md](README_mae.md) for details.

**Main differences.** In U-MAE, we introduce a ``uniformity_loss``  (implemented in ``loss_func.py``) as a uniformity regularization to the MAE loss. It also introduces an additional hyper-parameter ``lamb`` (default to ``1e-2``) in ``pretrain.sh``, which represents the coefficient of the uniformity regularization in the U-MAE loss. 

**Minor points:**
1. We add a linear classifier to monitor the online linear accuracy and its gradient will not be backward propagated to the backbone encoder.
2. For efficiency, we only train U-MAE for 200 epochs, and accordingly, we adopt 20 warmup epochs.
